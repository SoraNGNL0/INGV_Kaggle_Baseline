# IGNV_baseline
This project is about the code of the Kaggle [IGVN competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe), in which we got a ranking of 29/620.Because of the relatively small amount of data, we still use the method of feature extraction + machine learning. It is worth noting that the use of two-dimensional time-frequency features and AdaBoost can get better results.
